        What challenges did you encounter while creating the folder structure and linking to files and directories? </p>

    <blockquote>I encountered many challenges, like mistyping folder names and getting confused between document-relative and root-relative paths, especially with the dots. Also, I often misspelled image names, so I couldnâ€™t link them correctly. These were some of the main challenges I faced.

        Q2: How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any broken links or references? </p>

    <blockquote>When troubleshooting broken links or references, I follow these steps:
        Check the Path: Make sure the file or link path is correct. Even small mistakes, like wrong capitalization or missing file extensions, can cause issues.

        Test the Link: Open the link directly in the browser to see if it works. Use developer tools to check if the file is missing or causes an error.

        Verify File Names: Double-check that the file names match exactly, including capitalization and extensions (e.g., .jpg vs .jpeg).

        Check Permissions: Make sure the files have the right permissions to be accessed.

        Test in Different Browsers: Sometimes, broken links only show up in specific browsers. Test in multiple browsers or use incognito mode to avoid caching issues.

        Use Link Checkers: Use online tools like W3C Link Checker to find broken links.

        Clear Cache: Clear the browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl + F5) to load the latest version.

    Q3: What did you learn about the relationship between HTML and file structure in web development projects? </p>

    <blockquote> I learned that the paths of the files need to be the same. If your file is not in the path that you specified in the HTML, then it's not going to work. Similarly, the names of the files, images, and folders should be exactly the same.
        If there is even a difference in capitalization, it won't work.

        Q4: What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how did you overcome it? </p>

    <blockquote>The most challenging part of the assignment was meeting specific CSS requirements, particularly with layout techniques like floats and centering elements, as well as styling components while maintaining a responsive, modern design.
        Also my nav links got messed up many times.To overcome this, I revisited the instructional videos posted by Professor Leo and took some help from ChatGPT for guidance on using floats and positioning images and gallery items,
        which proved to be the most challenging aspect of the project. For nav links i wrapped it up in a container then applied styling to it. Also at the the end i revisited my html and css code i found so many extra codes were not effecting the page at all.
        So i revised it line by line and checked the live server to see the changes, if there were extra codes that were not necessary i removed them, like extra divs, classes and box-shadows.
